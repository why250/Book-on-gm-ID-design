Discover a fresh approach to efficient and insight-driven analog integrated circuit
design in nanoscale-CMOS with this hands-on guide.

* Expert authors present a sizing methodology that employs SPICE-generated lookup tables, enabling close agreement between hand analysis and simulation.
* Illustrates the exploration of analog circuit tradeoffs using the $g_m/I_D$ ratio as a central variable in script-based design flows, captured in downloadable Matlab code.
* Includes over forty detailed worked examples, including the design of low-noise and low-distortion gain stages, and operational transconductance amplifiers.  

Whether you are a professional analog circuit designer, a researcher, or a graduate student, this book will provide you with the theoretical know-how and practical
tools you need to acquire a systematic and re-use oriented design style for analog integrated circuits in modern CMOS.
